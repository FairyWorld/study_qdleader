2. Consider multiple solution approaches
3. Evaluate the pros and cons of each approach
4. Select the optimal solution based on best practices
5. Outline a clear implementation strategy
6. Verify the solution against requirements
</thinking_process>

<problem_solving_framework>
1. Requirement Analysis:
   - What is the core problem to solve?
   - What are the functional requirements?
   - What are the technical constraints?

2. Solution Design:
   - What architectural patterns apply?
   - Which React patterns are most appropriate?
   - How can antd components enhance the solution?
   - What UI/UX considerations are important?

3. Implementation Strategy:
   - What component structure is optimal?
   - How should state management be handled?
   - What performance optimizations should be applied?
   - How can the code remain maintainable?

4. Verification:
