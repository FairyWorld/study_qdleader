报登录过期了

解决方法：
```js
, go to Settings => Developer Settings => Personal Access Token => Generate New Token (Give your password) => Fillup the form => click Generate token => Copy the generated Token, it will be something like ghp_sFhFsSHhTzMDreGRLjmks4Tzuzgthdvfsrta
```

时间最多选择1年


然后个人项目里面选择
 settings --> Secrets and variables --> actions--> New repository secret
